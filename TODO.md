# To-do List

## Considerations

- Theory is slow affff
- b will be useless after a while
- New approximation methods

- Ok so, random crazy idea, make tdot be a function of zeta(s) so that when zeta(s) is big dot is higher and when zeta(s) is small tdot is lower 
    - Something like tdot = (9 * zeta(s) + 2 ) / 200
